##### what the script does:

*The script starts by importing several modules that are needed for the script to work. These include the os module, which provides functions for interacting with the operating system, the time module, which provides functions for working with time, and the webdriver module, which provides the webdriver object that is used to control a web browser.

*The script then creates a new instance of the webdriver object, which is used to control a web browser. In this case, the script uses the Chrome function to create a new Chromium browser.

*The script uses the get function of the webdriver object to navigate to Google's homepage.

*The script uses the save_screenshot function of the webdriver object to take a screenshot of the current page and save it as a file. The file is saved in a folder called images and has a file name of screenshot.jpg.

*The script uses the get function again to navigate to Imgur's homepage.

*The script uses the find_element_by_css_selector function of the webdriver object to find the login button on the page, and then uses the get_attribute function to get the URL of the login page. The script then navigates to the login page using the get function.

*The script uses the find_element_by_css_selector function to find the username and password fields on the login page, and then uses the send_keys function to enter your login credentials into these fields.

*The script uses the find_element_by_css_selector function to find the login form on the page, and then uses the submit function to submit the form.

*The script uses the sleep function of the time module to pause for 5 seconds, to give the page time to load.

*The script uses the find_element_by_css_selector function to find the "New Post" button on the page, and then uses the get_attribute function to get the URL of the upload page. The script then navigates to the upload page using the get function.

*The script uses the find_element_by_css_selector function to find the file input field on the upload page, and then uses the send_keys function to enter the file path to the screenshot file.

*The script uses the sleep function to pause for 5 seconds, to give the upload time to complete.

*The script uses the find_element_by_css_selector function to find the submit button on the page, and then uses the click function to click the button.

*Finally, the script uses the close function of the webdriver object to close the browser.
